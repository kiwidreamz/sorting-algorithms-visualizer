# Algorithm Visualizer

This is a web app built on the React framework using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.
It visualizes four different algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.

The user is greeted with an array of values each represented as a bar-like div whose height is the array's value in pixels.
You can re-generate a new array as many times as you'd like. A stop button refreshes the page and restarts the app.
